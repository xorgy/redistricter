Based on US Census Data, create congressional districts or other equal population districts for state legislatures or other purposes. Currently two solving algorithms are implemented which try to produce district maps with the lowest average distance per person to the center of their district. Results from these solvers are within 1% population variance between districts and usually create contiguous districts. A little tightening up and it could be ready to go for the 2010 census (if not for actual use, then to use to try and embarrass the map makers to gerrymander a little less).
